## Notes
I guess the real issue is that you need to transform info in such a way that you don't destroy it. but how do i do it without 

## TEMP
Lets just do a simple substitution for now and we can figure out the nitty gritty later
do a regular alphabet substitution. abcdef for qwerty and all the rest of it.

about numbers... i guess we can inputthem at the starts and output them at the end. 
#abcdef > qwert#

subs.temp seems to be okey, the "a" is not changing for some reason, also the size of letters data is corrupted if the swap happens with a number. and symbols. its just a temp thing. lets try witha  bigger file..

If you put it thjrough the algorightm twice then it doesn't decode so that's good..
